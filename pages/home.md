# RoSA
*RoSA (Robot System Assistant)** is an intuitive multimodal interface for interacting with robots through speech, touch, and gestures. Developed through a multi-year research project, RoSA has evolved from a Wizard-of-Oz prototype into a robust control interface, evaluated in both on-site and remote industrial settings. It supports natural humanâ€“robot collaboration by simplifying robot selection, task assignment, and feedback in dynamic multi-robot environments.
