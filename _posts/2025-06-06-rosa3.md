## Bridging Local and Remote Human–Robot Interaction with RoSA 3

This paper investigates **hybrid interaction models** for collaborative robots, combining on-site and telerobotic control through the same interface. Building on earlier RoSA frameworks, the study evaluates **touch and speech input** modalities to understand their strengths and trade-offs in both local and remote settings.

**Key features of RoSA 3:**

- Supports **touchscreen and speech** input through a unified interaction concept
- Evaluates **two robots**: Rosa (UR5e with gripper) and Ari (humanoid with touchscreen)
- Incorporates a **React-based touchscreen UI** integrated with ROS and a local **speech understanding pipeline** using Picovoice SLU
- Includes a new **Commander** module for managing and fusing multimodal commands
