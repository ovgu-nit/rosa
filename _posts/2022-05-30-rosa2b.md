## Real-Time Face Recognition and Tracking for Human–Robot Interaction

This paper presents a **lightweight, ROS-integrated face recognition and tracking framework** for real-time human–robot interaction (HRI), designed to handle unconstrained environments including occlusions, lighting variations, and pose changes.

The framework is implemented as part of the **RoSA (Robot System Assistant)**, supporting intuitive interaction with industrial robots via **facial, speech, and gesture input**. Built on **RetinaFace** and **ArcFace** and combined with **SORT-based face tracking**, it significantly improves recognition reliability and system performance.

### Key Highlights:
- **ArcFace + MobileFaceNet** for robust feature embeddings with high recognition precision.
- **RetinaFace with MobileNet** enables fast and accurate detection and alignment.
- **SORT tracking** integrates Kalman filtering and Hungarian matching for efficient multi-face tracking.
- Achieves **~35 FPS**, enabling real-time operation on ROS-powered robotic systems.
- Tested on **RoSA’s real-time experiments** and **Wizard-of-Oz videos** with **11 and 36 subjects**, respectively.

### Evaluation:
- Average precision: **99%**, recall: **95%**, F-score: **97%**
- Online evaluation shows tracking boosts recognition rate from **76% → 94%**
- Dataset validation on ChokePoint confirms consistent improvements in recognition and speed.

### Practical Impact:
By assigning IDs to tracked faces and fusing them with body tracking, RoSA:
- Avoids identity mix-ups,
- Enables seamless multi-user interaction,
- Enhances UX in collaborative robotic tasks.

This work lays the foundation for integrating **perceptual identity** into intelligent HRI systems and scales to real-world industrial applications.
