## Wizard-of-Oz Study on Natural Robot Control using Touch and Speech

This study presents the first prototype of **RoSA (Robot System Assistant)**, a multimodal robot interaction system designed for intuitive control in industrial environments. Using a **Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ)** approach, 36 participants interacted with what they believed to be an intelligent robot system—when in fact it was secretly controlled by a human operator.

The setup involved a **UR5e robot**, speech and gesture input, and a task-based scenario where users had to request blocks, spell words, and build a pyramid using voice and pointing gestures. A **deliberate error** was introduced during each task to observe how users adapt to misunderstandings and failures.

### Key findings:
- **97% of participants used speech input**, with **72% combining it with gestures**, confirming the natural tendency toward **multimodal communication**.
- Despite system flaws and simulated failures, **users rated RoSA highly**, with an **average UX score of 74%** across four usability questionnaires (SUS, UMUX, PSSUQ, ASQ).
- The experiment showed **strong correlations between gesture and descriptive speech**, and between micro/macro gestures and task efficiency.
- Users often assumed RoSA to be similar to AI assistants like Alexa or Google, indicating **preconceptions shaped interaction behavior**.
- A **gesture catalog** was derived from the participants’ suggestions, identifying common intuitive motions for actions like move, stop, and gripper control.

This study not only validates the intuitive potential of the RoSA concept but also provides a catalog of interaction strategies and gestures that laid the groundwork for the development of RoSA 2.0 and 3.0.
