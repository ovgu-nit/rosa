## Real-Time Engagement Estimation for Human–Robot Collaboration

This study presents a **multimodal engagement prediction model** for human–robot interaction in industrial environments. Designed for **multi-person, open-world settings**, the system uses a combination of deep learning and rule-based policies to predict when humans intend to interact with a collaborative robot (cobot) and when they disengage.

**Key features:**

- **Three-stage architecture**:  
  1. Deep learning for feature extraction (gaze, head pose, body posture, face ID)  
  2. A neural network to estimate the **focus of attention**  
  3. Rule-based classification to decide on engagement/disengagement

- **Person identification** via face recognition allows tracking and re-engagement across multiple users.

- Validated through an **study with 11 participants**, performing collaborative tasks with a UR5e cobot.

- Achieved performance:  
  - Precision: **96%**  
  - Recall: **90%**  
  - F-score: **93%**

- Participants rated the engagement module with a **satisfaction score of 5.65** (on a 7-point scale).

- Real-time capable, with a total frame processing time of approximately 40 ms.

This work supports **safe, contactless, multimodal human–robot collaboration** suitable for multi-user industrial applications.
